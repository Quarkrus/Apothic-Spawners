Apothic Spawners, formerly the Spawner Module of [Apotheosis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis), is a mod that allows you to modify Mob Spawners with various vanilla items. Through modification, you can create faster and more efficient spawners than ever before!

# Mob Spawners
Mob Spawners can be picked up with silk touch, and have a variety of stats that control their behavior.   

The most basic stats are provided by vanilla:  
* __Minimum Spawn Delay__ - The lower bound (in ticks) of the time between spawns.
* __Maximum Spawn Delay__ - The upper bound (in ticks) of the time between spawns.
* __Spawn Count__ - The upper bound on the number of entities spawned.
* __Max Nearby Entities__ - The max number of entities (of the spawning type) that can be nearby before spawning stops.
* __Required Player Range__ - The radius (in blocks) that a player must be within for the spawner to be active.
* __Spawn Range__ - The radius (in blocks) that the spawner will attempt to spawn entities.

Some more advanced stats are provided by Apotheosis:
* __Initial Health__ - The amount of max health (in percentage) that mobs will be spawned with.
* __Ignore Players__ - If the spawner ignores the required player range and activates regardless.
* __Ignore Conditions__ - If the spawner ignores all spawn rules for the spawned entity.
* __Redstone Control__ - If the spawner must be activated by a redstone signal.
* __Ignore Light__ - If the spawner will spawn the target entity regardless of light level.
* __No AI__ - If spawned mobs have the No AI flag set. They will still be moved by gravity and external force.
* __Silent__ - If spawned mobs have the Silent flag set. They will make no sound.
* __Youthful__ - If possible, spawned mobs will be babies.
* __Burning__ - Mobs will be spawned on fire.
* __Echoing__ - Spawned mobs will drop an additional copy of their loot table on death.

# Spawner Modifiers
To adjust the stats of a spawner, you must use a Spawner Modifier.  
These are recipes that accept one or two input items (held in your hands), that when right-clicking a spawner will apply the indicated stat change.    
Spawner modifiers have individual caps on the stats they modify, and can modify more than one stat at once.

Hovering over the modified stats will show a description of the stat, and the modifier-specific min or max value.

# Capturing
The spawner module also adds the __Capturing__ enchantment. This enchantment applies to swords, and gives mobs a chance to drop their spawn egg on death.  Spawn eggs can be used to change the mob that a mob spawner spawns.
